{"0": ["Welcome to the History of Linux", "Linux turned 30 in 2021. The first Linux kernel was made public on September 17, 1991. So what exactly is \nLinux? Linux is a community of open-source operating systems that are developed on top of the Linux kernel. \nLinux comes packaged within Linux distributions.\nWhat about Linux distributions? Linux distributions, \nor fondly called distro, are nothing but software collections based on the Linux kernel and a package \nmanagement system. Users get to use Linux generally by downloading and installing a distro into their \nmachines. We\u2019ll have a more detailed discussion about Linux distributions in the later part of this write-up.\n\nLinux was written by Finnish-American Software Engineer Linus Benedict Torvalds. Are you interested to know \nthe history of Linux? How was it created? What\u2019s the story behind the development and naming? How did Linux \ncome under the GNU GPL license? What\u2019s Linux mascot? What are the latest developments? What\u2019s there between \nMicrosoft and Linux?\u2026 Then this article is just for you. Let\u2019s start!"], "1": ["What Inspired Creating Linux", "AT&T was dropped from Multics. This led to the invention and \nimplementation of the Unix OS in 1969. Unix was created by American Computer Science legends Kenneth Lane \nThompson and Dennis MacAlistair Ritchie of AT&T Bell Labs. And the first version was released in 1970.\n2 years \nlater they created C out of UNIX. And there comes the future base of many programming languages! C added \nportability and availability to UNIX and thus it became increasingly popular, widely adopted, modified, \nand copied by businesses and academic institutions across the globe. AT&T was the sole owner of the UNIX \ncopyrights.\nAmerican Programmer Richard Matthew Stallman began the GNU project to create a free UNIX-like \noperating system in 1983. He wrote GPL (GNU General Public License) as a part of his project. By the 1990s, \nthere was enough software to build a complete operating system. However, Hurd, the GNU kernel couldn\u2019t pull \nenough development work leaving GNU incomplete.\nIn 1987, American-Dutch Professor Andrew S. Tanenbaum wrote \nUNIX-like system MINIX for academic use. The source code of MINIX was made available for everyone, however, \nMINIX couldn\u2019t be either modified or redistributed. MINIX\u2019s 16-bit architecture wasn\u2019t well adapted to Intel\u2019s \nincreasingly popular 386 design for PCs. It became highly expensive for private users to use UNIX for Intel 386 \npersonal computers.\nAnd this led to Linus Torvalds\u2019 beginning of a new project. Later Linus Torvalds stated that \nif either 386BSD or GNU Hurd was available during his time, he wouldn\u2019t be interested in writing his project."], "2": ["The Story Behind the Name Linux", "Linus Torvalds had Freax in mind as the name of Linux. Torvalds created \nFreax as an amalgamation of three words \u2013 Free, Freak, and X from UNIX. For about half a year, Linus Torvalds \nused Freax as his file storage. Initially, Linux was considered but dismissed as it might sound \u201cegotistical\u201d.\nIn \nSeptember 1991, FUNET\u2019s FTP server was used to upload files for the purpose of development. However, Ari Lemmke \nat HUT  (Helsinki University of Technology), one of the FTP\u2019s volunteer administrators, wasn\u2019t quite fond of the \nname Freax. So, he altered the name as Linux on the FTP server. Later Torvalds consented to the same.\nTorvalds \nadded an audio guide to the Linux kernel source code to correctly pronounce the word Linux. Although the kernel \nwas often used with other software of the GNU Project, the designation \u201cLinux\u201d was primarily used only for the \nkernel. It\u2019s in fact, kernel very quickly became GNU software\u2019s most popular adoption.\nIn June 1994, \nLinux was called a \u201cfree UNIX clone\u201d in GNU\u2019s bulletin. Also, the Debian Project named its product Debian \nGNU/Linux. In May 1996, Stallman published Emacs 19.31 editor. In the same, Linux became Lignux combining GNU and \nLinux. But soon GNU/Linux was favored over Lignux.\nThe name GNU/Linux garnered mixed reactions from the Linux \ncommunity and users. Debian and the GNU projects preferred to use this name. But people generally liked to use \nLinux."], "3": ["Torvalds\u2019 Linux Development", "On August 25, 1991, Linus Torvalds began his project while studying at the \nUniversity of Helsinki. This very project turned out to be the Linux kernel. It was based on MINIX. Also, \nGNU C Compiler was used in the development.\nTorvalds\u2019 new program was for the hardware used by him and \nindependent of any OS. Linus aimed to use the functions of his PC having an 80386 microprocessor. Years later in \n2001, Torvalds penned down his autobiography Just for Fun: The Story of an Accidental Revolutionary. In the book, \nhe mentioned he started his project as \u201cjust a hobby\u201d and ended up with an OS kernel. Then he was only 21 and \nannounced the new project via a Usenet Newsgroup comp.os.minix.\nSo, what\u2019s a Usenet Newsgroup? A Usenet Newsgroup \nis nothing but a Usenet repository used for updates posted by its users. They are basically discussion groups. \nand not particularly used for publishing news. Newsgroups are not technically but functionally the same as \ndiscussion forums. Newsreader clients are used for reading newsgroup content.\nAs per Linus Torvalds, \nLinux started gaining importance after porting X Window System to Linux created by Orest Zborowski. If you want \nto learn more about Orest Zborowski this interview might interest you. X Window System or X11 is common on \nUNIX-based operating systems. It\u2019s windowing for bitmap displays."], "4": ["Role of GNU GPL in Linux", "The first Linux kernel was published under its very own license. This had some \nrestrictions on commercial activities. However, the first Linux kernel 0.01 was released with a GNU Bash shell\u2019s \nbinary. The software included was developed under the GNU GPL or GNU General Public License. It was a part of the \ninfamous GNU project.\nLinus Torvalds wrote the \u201cNotes for linux release 0.01\u201d. In this note, he mentioned the GNU \nsoftware required to run Linux. Also, he revealed that most of the tools come under the GNU copyleft. Now, \nwhat\u2019s copyleft? Copyleft is the practice where you are authorized to modify and freely distribute intellectual \nproperty. And you\u2019ll be required to preserve the rights in derivatives created out of that same property.\n\nCopyleft licenses are able to maintain copyright conditions of documents, computer software, art, \netc. The information required for Copyleft is generally in source code file formats.\nTorvalds wanted to release \nthe Linux kernel under the GNU GPL License in 1992. And he made this announcement in the release notes version \n0.12. In mid-December of the same year, Torvalds published version 0.99 with the GNU GPL license. Linux and GNU \ndevelopers\u2019 joint efforts integrated Linux with GNU components to create a fully functional free OS. Linus once \nmade a statement by saying \u2013 \u201cmaking Linux GPLed was definitely the best thing I ever did.\u201d\nAround 2000, \nLinus Torvalds announced Linux kernel comes under the GPLv2 license. After years of drafts and discussions, \nin 2007, Torvalds released GPLv3. But the majority of Linux developers including Torvalds wasn\u2019t ready to adopt \nthe new license."], "5": ["Linux Mascot", "In 1996, Linus Torvalds made the announcement of a Linux Mascot. When the Linux team was \ninto the mascot selection, Torvalds mentioned a personal story. It was about a little penguin that had bitten him \nwhen he visited the National Zoo & Aquarium of Canberra, Australia. Then the team considered a penguin to be the \nofficial Linux mascot.\nAmerican Programmer Larry Ewing presented the draft of today\u2019s Linux mascot based on \nLinus\u2019 experience with the little penguin. James Hughes suggested Tux as the name of the mascot. Tux came from \nTorvalds\u2019 UNIX, along with being the contraction of the Tuxedo having a similar color to that of the penguin."], "6": ["Linux Distributions", "While talking about Linux, Linux distributions can no way be skipped, because Linux \ndistributions complete Linux as an operating system and a community altogether.\nIn 1991, after developing the \nkernel, Linus Torvalds distributed the first version, 0.01 as only a source code. Later a downloadable floppy \ndisk image pair was also distributed. This pair contained one bootable disk image including the Linux kernel and \nanother disk image having a set of GNU utilities, tools to set up a file system.\nHowever, the installation \nprocedure wasn\u2019t that easy. Linux distributions worked like wonders to ease up installations, and especially in \nthe face of increasing software availabilities. H. J. Lu\u2019s \u201cBoot-root\u201d, a downloadable disk image pair including \nLinux kernel and the minimal tools, can be called the first Linux distribution available released in 1991. Other \nearly distros include MCC Interim Linux, Softlanding Linux System or SLS, and Yggdrasil Linux/GNU/X, all in 1992.\nSLS \nwasn\u2019t maintained well. So, a new distribution, Slackware based on SLS, was released in July 1993. Patrick \nVolkerding is the developer and maintainer of the same. Also, Ian Murdock created Debian as a free Linux \ndistribution and released it in December 1993. So, Slackware and Debian are the two oldest and still running \nLinux distributions.\nLinux distributions garnered positive responses from the users as the  DOS and Windows \nalternatives in IBM PC compatible machines, Mac OS in the Apple Macintosh, and UNIX\u2019s proprietary versions. \nPeople used to use UNIX in their schools and/or workplaces. Linux distributions were appreciated for being \nlow-cost or completely free, and for providing source code."], "7": ["10 Facts about Linux", "1. The software is free. You don\u2019t have to shed a dime for this operating system.\n\n2. At the beginning of the project, the first Linux kernel occupied only 65 KB. Today, even a regular Linux \nkernel contains over 10 million lines of source code.\n3. Nearly 12,000 developers from more than 1,200 companies \nhave contributed to the Linux kernel since tracking began 10 years ago.\n4. Linux runs on just about any hardware \nfrom mobile phones to supercomputers. The open source nature of the kernel and software means it can be ported to \nanother architecture by a third party, while the end user doesn\u2019t need to care about the underlying hardware.\n5. \nOut of top 500 fastest supercomputers of the world, Linux or its variants power 485 of those badass machines. No \nwonder Linux is considered the king of supercomputing.\n6. The Linux OS has been around since the early nineties \nand has managed to stay fairly secure in the realm of widespread viruses, spyware and adware. By making the \nsource available to anyone, security experts can proactively identify any main security flaws in the operating \nsystem before they become public.\n7. The rate of Linux development remains unmatched \u2013 Linux kernel 3.15 had the \nbusiest development cycle in the kernel\u2019s history. On average, 7.71 kernel code changes are submitted per hour \u2013 \nthat translates to 185 changes every day and nearly 1,300 per week.\n8. Linux users don\u2019t usually have \u201croot\u201d \nprivileges, but lower-level accounts. This means that even if a Linux system is compromised, the virus doesn\u2019t \nhave root access to do system wide damage; more likely, only the user\u2019s local files and programs would be \naffected.\n9. Linux powers the New York Stock Exchange, the Department of Defense of the US, the US. Navy \nSubmarine Fleet, Japan\u2019s bullet trains, traffic control of San Francisco, CERN, many air traffic control systems \nor control of nuclear reactors of submarines and ships \u2013 plus, Google, Cisco, Facebook, Twitter, Linked in, \nToyota, etc.\n10. According to openhub.net, the majority (95%) of Linux is written in C language. The second \npopular language for Linux is assembly language (2.8%)."], "8": ["List of Linux Distributions", "1.

Every major software package has been ported \nto Linux. Also, commercial software is coming to the public. Today, many software developers begin their \ndevelopment journey with Linux apps.\nAnd not to forget the hardware support! More and more hardware is being \nsupported by Linux with the passing time than they are by the original Linux kernel.
